Problem 1: the problem would not work, there was an error saying it could not find module Tkinter. This is because to use Tkinter you have to use a lower case _t_ to call it so it would be tkinter
method prior knowledge

- Solution: change all Tkinter to tkinter

Problem 2: Not really a problem but more suggestion, change the name of Background variables to be more detailed on what they mean or at least add comments because it was hard to understand what you were doing with them

- Solved: I renamed the variables

Problem 3: when creating the window for general safety, it would appear before the main page window and the main page will only open when general safety was closed

- Method: prior knowledge I know that order matters and have done multi-window programs before and if I want it to appear in a certain time I have to put it in an if statement that checks for the condition

 - Solution: move the code for creating a new window into the function being called when the button is pressed so it will only appear then


 Problem 4: forgot how to change background colour
 - method prior knowledge I remembered I did it before so I looked at previous

 - solution: use the command .config(bg="colour")
 - still did not work
 - method trial and error
  - tried different colours
  - made sure I spelt it correctly 
  - change lower and upper case b
  tried change to .Background()
  - searched up video and it has to be configure(bg="color)")

change 1: move quit button to top right corner
  - reason because it looks more aesthetically pleasing
