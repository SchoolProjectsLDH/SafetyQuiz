# Python Safety Quiz

This repository holds all the code for our Grade 11 Python summative.

The goal:
-
A "fill in the blank" quiz with a word bank and 10 questions. There will be three categories (power tools, hand tools, general safety) and at the end the persons mark will be displayed. As the user inputs the words into the blanks, the word in the **wordbank** will disappear.
- 3 categories
- 10 questions per category
- Python graphics
- A real-time word bank that updates as the user answers questions

Team Effort:
-
Due to the complexity of this project, our teacher has allowed us to work in as a pair (Josh and I). To make the collaboration easier we chose to use Github for code sharing and version control. We also intend to follow the SDLC to facilitate the process.
